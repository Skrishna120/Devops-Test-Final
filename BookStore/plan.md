# ðŸ“š **BookXpress - Your Go-To eCommerce Bookstore with a Rewarding Twist!** ðŸ“š

## **Overview:**

Welcome to **BookXpress**, an innovative eCommerce platform designed for book lovers and savvy shoppers alike! At BookXpress, we not only let you buy and resell books but also reward you for being a loyal customer with our unique **Points System**. Earn points with every purchase and use them to get **discounts on future buys**â€”because who doesn't love a great deal on books?

## **The Idea**

At BookXpress, we want to change the way you buy books. Our platform allows you to:

- **Buy new books** at full price.
- **Earn points** with every purchase.
- **Spend your earned points** to get **discounts** on future book purchasesâ€”up to **50% off**!
- **Resell your books** to get back a portion of the original price, making reading not just a hobby, but an investment in your future.

---

## **How It Works**

### 1. **Earn Points on Purchase**:

- Every time you buy a new book, you **earn points** based on the book's price.
- For example, if you purchase a book for â‚¹500, you might earn **500 points** (or a percentage of the price, depending on the points system defined).

### 2. **Redeem Points for Discounts**:

- You can redeem your accumulated points to get a discount of up to **50%** on the price of a new book.
- **Discount Cap**: The discount you can apply through points will not exceed **50%** of the book's price.
- The more points you accumulate, the greater the savings on your next book purchase!

### 3. **Resell Your Books**:

- After enjoying your books, you can resell **Ultra Premium** and **Premium** books (but not **General** books) back to the platform at a reduced price.
- The resale value is based on the **book's depreciation** and **service charges** (details mentioned below).

### 4. **Categories of Books**:

- **Ultra Premium Books**: These high-end, expensive books can be resold for a portion of their original price.
- **Premium Books**: Slightly less expensive than ultra-premium, but still valuable and resellable.
- **General Books**: Everyday, affordable books that cannot be resold.

## **Points System Breakdown**

### 1. **Earning Points**:

- Points are awarded for every purchase.
- The points value can be calculated as a percentage of the book price.
- Example: A book worth â‚¹500 could earn you **500 points** (1 point = â‚¹1).

### 2. **Redeeming Points**:

- You can redeem your points for discounts up to **50%** on a new book.
- Example: If you have accumulated **1,000 points** and want to buy a â‚¹2,000 book, you can redeem **1,000 points** to get â‚¹1,000 off.
- The **maximum discount is capped at 50%**, so youâ€™ll always have to pay at least 50% of the book's price.

### 3. **Resale Points**:

- You can redeem a portion of your earned points for resale value when selling Ultra Premium or Premium books back to BookXpress.
- However, points earned on a resale are not redeemable for discounts.

- **Premium Books**:
  - These books can be resold for up to **40%** of their original price with a similar depreciation and service charge policy as Ultra Premium books.

### 3. **Sustainability**:
